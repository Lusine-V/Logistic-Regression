# Logistic-Regression
Creating a model for a telecommunication company, to predict when its customers will leave for a competitor, so that they can take some action to retain the customers.

The dataset includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn

Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies

Customer account information – how long they had been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges

Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
